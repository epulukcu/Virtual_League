# VIRTUAL LEAGUE

There are 18 teams in the Virtual League. 
This number can be changed if necessary. 
Team names (one or more words) and coach names (two words) are read from 
the file named “takimlar.txt”.
While the team names are read from the file, 
aliases of the related teams are created. 
These nicknames must consist of 2 or 3 letters. 
Each team has a different nickname. 
Nickname and technical director information of the relevant team 
whose team name is entered in the application are displayed on the screen.
